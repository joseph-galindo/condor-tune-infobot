So if you are the first to kill the ND you get 4 points, but if nobody kills the ND then the person who got the furthest gets 3 points.\n\nIf multiple racers die on the same floor, the one who got to this floor first is considered ahead.\n\nIf you are not in at least Zone 2 when all other racers have finished, the race will be stopped.\n\nIn addition, there will be a 5 minute sudden-death tiebreaker for any racers level on points before semi-finals and finals.```",

It also follows the same rules and zoom restrictions as CoNDOR.\n\nGenerally, entrants can clear Cadence consistently, but will take longer than seasoned CoNDOR racers (about 10 minutes on average).\n\nFor the most part, historically Conduit has only had Cadence races (as opposed to other characters).\n\nNext Conduit will be: July 29, 2016 at 7pm EST.\nBracket is at: <http://stats.condorleague.tv>\nWill be streamed at: <http://live.condorleague.tv>\nSignups are: currently unavailable, please try to signup for the next Conduit at: <http://signup.condorleague.tv>.```",
