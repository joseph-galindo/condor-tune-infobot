Racers will compete within four regions: NA West, NA East, Asia, and Europe. Each racer will race every other racer within their region, and the top 3 in each region advance to an 12-person elimination bracket for the championship. The group stage runs for three weeks, with each racer doing 2-3 races per week, followed by a one-week championship round ending September 9-10 to crown the world champion! Prize money is still TBD, but will be at least $500.\n\nYou must be available every week from August 15th until September 10th to participate - there will be no makeup weeks for the mini-season. CoNDOR staff will use reasonable discretion combined with objective criteria to pick the best 8 racers in each region. Finally, racers must be willing to stream via RTMP - instructions will be circulated when ready.```",
